# tsekI

## Key Structs and Enums

### tsekIWindow
A handle to a window. Contains a pointer to the platform-specific data for a certain window. Do not attempt to access this yourself, use defined platform-generic functions to extract and modify data.

### tsekIContext
A handle to a context. Contains a pointer to the platform-specific data for a global context. Again, do not attempt to access this yourself, use defined platform-generic functions for this purpose. One tsekIContext is bound at a time - this will soon be changed to be thread safe.

### tsekIKeyCode
An enum containing a member for each key on a keyboard - redefined as to be platform agnostic. It includes toggles and mouse buttons. Prefixed TSEK_[KEY].

### tsekIWindowState
An enum describing window fullscreen-state. Options are:

`TSEKI_WINDOWED`
Doesnt occupy full screen, respects taskbar etc. Default on Linux.

`TSEKI_WINDOWED_FULLSCREEN`
Occupies full screen, respects taskbar etc. Not supported on Linux.

`TSEKI_BORDERLESS`
Occupies full screen, overtakes taskbar etc. Supported on Linux.

### tsekIWindowParam
An enum containing parameters that can be set or retrieved for a specific window. More details in the `tsekI_get_parameter` and `tsekI_set_parameter` sections.

### tsekIPixelFormat
A struct to contain a preference for the data stored in each pixel of the screen. Note that data "suggested" in this way is not set, but is instead used to rank available pixel formats and choose the best. The members are:  

`uint16_t r_bits, g_bits, b_bits, a_bits`
Set the number of bits in each of the 4 respective channels. Defaults to 8.  

`uint16_t depth_bits`
Sets the number of bits used in storing depth information. Defaults to 24.  

`uint16_t stencil_bits`
Sets the number of bits used in the stencil buffer. Defaults to 8.  

`uint8_t samples`
Sets the numbers of samples per pixel. Defaults to 4.  

### tsekIWindowInfo
A struct to contain data used in window initialisation. Contains

`const wchar_t* title`
The title of the window. Only used in Windows.

`uint32_t width, height`
The dimensions of the window. Overwritten by most Linux WMs.

`uint32_t classId`, `const wchar_t* wndClassName`
The windows class specifiers. Usually redundant, can be ignored.

`uint32_t style, extendedStyle`
Used in defining windows style in certain window managers.

`tsekPixelFormat pixelFormat`
The preferred pixel format.

### tsekICallbacks
Defines functions to be called upon specified window events. All pass the window in question as the first argument. They are:

`void (*keydown)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode);`
Called on keydown. Passes pressed key.

`void (*keytype)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode);`
Called on keytype; the repeated call when a key is held down. Passes pressed key.

`void (*keyup)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode);`
Called on keyup. Passes released key.

`void (*mbdown)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode);`
Called on mouse button down. Passes pressed (mouse) button.

`void (*mbup)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode);`
Called on mouse button up. Passes pressed (mouse) button.

`void (*kstate)(tsekIWindow*, tsekKeyCode, bool);`
Called on key state (caps lock, num lock, scroll lock) toggle. Passes key and state.

`void (*size)(tsekIWindow*, uint32_t width, uint32_t height);`
Called on window resize. Passes width and height.

`void (*tsegsize)(tsekIWindow*, uint32_t width, uint32_t height);`
Called on window resize, reserved for graphics APIs.

`void (*statechange)(tsekIWindow*, tsekIWindowState);`
Called on window state change. Passes window state.

### tsekIPos
Utility struct for storing position and size information of a rect. Contains:

`uint32_t x, y`
The coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle (in pixels).

`uint32_t width, height`
The width and height of the rectangle in pixels.
